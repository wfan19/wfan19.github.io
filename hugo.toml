Studio teaching is increasingly popular, but teaching in one is difficult, especially for new instructors. \
We studied how new instructors learn to teach in a studio environment through a collective ethnography of \
four undergrad course assistants. We identified challenges new instructors faced and strategies they in response. *Olin* | *ASEE 2024*."""

Inspired by octopus arms, helically-wound muscles greatly increase continuum arm workspaces, but they are more difficult to model and control. \ 
We present a novel application of Lie theory to simplify the modeling of constant twist soft robots, and unify modeling across different designs. \
