I’m a graduating senior at Olin College of Engineering and robotics researcher. \

We present a novel model that unifies the kinematics of soft continuum robots of constant \
bending and twistin Our model generalizes across manipulators of different sizes and \
designs without the need for parameter re-fitting. We validate our model on six different \
