# Hi there

I’m a graduating senior at Olin College of Engineering and robotics researcher. I am interested in how computational models and bio-inspiration can help us design robots that can effectively work alongside us. So far, my work has taken me across three different labs between OSU, Olin, and UMass. 

Outside of research, I’ve also worked on SLAM and controls on autonomous systems, including an internship at Dusty Robotics.
