During the summer of 2020 my friend and I worked for a professional sailor in the Detroit area in his early stage startup to build an electric hydrofoiling boat.
Over that summer, we built a prototype of an autonomous hydrofoiling system by modifying an existing Nacra 17 hull, which achieved over a minute of stable autonomous airtime by the end of the summer.

Our work from that summer has lived on in the form of [Michigan Electric Boats](https://umeb.engin.umich.edu/OurBoats/), as my friend went on to co-found that project team.
Our work from the summer was the start of the team's first boat, which won 2nd place in the 2021 Promoting Electric Propulsion competition.
