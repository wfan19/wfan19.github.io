During my third-year, I co-founded Twist-Lab with Krishna Suresh and Luke Raus. We recruited a total of 10 students, and together worked on building, controlling, simulating, and motion-capturing various novel soft robotic systems. 

As PM, I was responsible for raising over $7,500 in funding for the lab, directing meetings and projects, and mentoring students in both their research and fellowship applications.
